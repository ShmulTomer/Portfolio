Tomer website ideas



	⁃	the white boxes with the title of the project and the description again looks like the default option. it looks unedited. u can def play around with the colors and the font. 

	⁃	the margins of the descriptions are kinda off. in some boxes they go till the end, in some they end a little sooner. it doesn’t look as clean maybe edit those.

	⁃	driveway prototype and meal planner app have descriptions in another language?
	⁃	meal planner app has no pic so add a pic
